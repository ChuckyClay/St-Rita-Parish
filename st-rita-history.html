    <p><b>Saint of the Impossible | Patroness of Hopeless Cases</b></p>
    <p><i>Feast Day: 22 May</i></p>

    <section>
      <h2>Historical Background</h2>
      <p>
        Saint Rita lived during the late 14th and 15th centuries in central Italy,
        a time marked by political instability, violence, and family feuds.
        Revenge killings were common, and forgiveness was rare.
        God raised Saint Rita in this troubled society as a powerful witness
        to peace, patience, forgiveness, and trust in His mercy.

      <h2>Birth and Early Life</h2>
      <p>
        Saint Rita was born around <b>1381</b> in the village of <b>Roccaporena</b>,
        near <b>Cascia in Umbria, Italy</b>. Her baptismal name was
        <b>Margherita Lotti</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her parents, <b>Antonio and Amata Lotti</b>, were devout Catholics
        and respected peacemakers who often reconciled feuding families.
        They were elderly and childless for many years, and Rita was
        received as a special gift from God.
      </p>
      <p>
        From childhood, Rita showed a deep love for prayer and solitude
        and expressed a strong desire to become a nun.
        According to tradition, bees surrounded her cradle without harming her,
        a sign of God’s favor that remained remembered by the villagers.

      <h2>Marriage and Domestic Suffering</h2>
      <p>
        In obedience to her parents and the customs of the time,
        Rita was married at a young age to <b>Paolo Mancini</b>,
        a man known for his violent temper and immoral life.
      </p>
      <p>
        For <b>18 years</b>, Rita endured physical abuse, emotional suffering,
        and humiliation. She never responded with anger or revenge.
        Instead, she remained faithful, patient, and prayerful,
        offering her suffering to God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through Rita’s constant prayer and forgiveness,
        Paolo eventually repented, abandoned violence,
        reconciled with his enemies, and became a loving husband.

      <h2>Widowhood and the Death of Her Sons</h2>
      <p>
        Despite his conversion, Paolo was later <b>murdered</b>
        by enemies from past feuds.
        Rita was left a widow with <b>two sons</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her sons desired revenge for their father’s death.
        Fearing for their souls, Rita prayed intensely that God
        would prevent them from committing mortal sin,
        even if it meant their death.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both sons later <b>died of illness</b>, reconciled with God and their mother.
        Though deeply sorrowful, Rita accepted this painful answer
        as an act of God’s mercy.

      <h2>Call to Religious Life and Entrance into the Convent</h2>
      <p>
        After losing her entire family, Rita sought to join the
        <b>Augustinian convent of Saint Mary Magdalene in Cascia</b>.
        She was initially refused because she was a widow
        and because of her husband’s violent past.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through perseverance and prayer, and according to tradition
        through a miraculous intervention of
        <b>Saint Augustine, Saint John the Baptist,
        and Saint Nicholas of Tolentino</b>,
        Rita was admitted into the convent.

      <h2>Life as an Augustinian Nun</h2>

        Her life was marked by deep prayer, obedience,
        humility, fasting, penance, and service to the sick and poor.
      </p>
      <p>

      <h2>The Stigma of the Thorn</h2>
      <p>
        While praying before a crucifix, Rita asked to share
        in the suffering of Christ.
        She received a <b>wound on her forehead</b>,
        believed to be from one of the thorns of Christ’s crown.
      </p>
      <p>
        The wound caused her great pain and isolation
        and remained with her for about <b>15 years</b>.
        Rita accepted this suffering joyfully
        and offered it for the salvation of souls.
